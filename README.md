# Ants vs Bees
This was made during my CS61A class at Berkeley. It is a game that focuses on object oriented programming. I was given some skeletal code and artwork to work with. I made changes only in ants.py. Feel free to download and try playing the game on your local machine. 

To run the game use the command in terminal: 
python gui.py -h -w --food 10

You can put in any number for food. 

Below is how it looks like through the web browser.
